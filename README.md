## Regression Models

### 1. Simple Linear Regression
- **Concept**: This is the most basic form of regression, where we model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
- **Use Case**: Predicting house prices based on square footage.

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
- **Concept**: Extends Simple Linear Regression by incorporating multiple independent variables to predict a single dependent variable.
- **Use Case**: Predicting house prices based on multiple factors like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

### 3. Polynomial Regression
- **Concept**: A form of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.
- **Use Case**: Modeling more complex, non-linear relationships between variables.

### 4. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- **Concept**: SVR aims to fit the best line within a threshold value so that the maximum number of data points are within this margin. It’s a powerful method for regression tasks in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Use Case**: Predicting financial trends or stock prices where the relationship isn't strictly linear.

### 5. Decision Tree Regression
- **Concept**: A decision tree builds a model by splitting the data into segments based on feature values, with the goal of making predictions as accurate as possible for each segment.
- **Use Case**: Predicting customer spending based on historical behavior.

### 6. Random Forest Regression
- **Concept**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of the model. The final prediction is typically the average prediction of all trees.
- **Use Case**: Predicting complex outcomes with multiple influencing factors, like sales forecasting.

## Classification Models

### 1. Logistic Regression
- **Concept**: Despite its name, Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that is used when the dependent variable is binary. It models the probability of a certain class or event.
- **Use Case**: Spam detection in emails (spam or not spam).

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Concept**: A non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on the classes of the k-nearest data points. It’s simple and effective for various classification problems.
- **Use Case**: Image recognition where similar images are grouped together.

### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Concept**: SVM is a powerful classifier that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. It’s particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Use Case**: Text classification where documents are categorized into different topics.

### 4. Breast Cancer Practical Case
- **Concept**: A real-world application of classification techniques to diagnose breast cancer. Various classification models are applied and compared.
- **Use Case**: Medical diagnosis based on patient data.

## Getting Started

To run any of these notebooks, you'll need to have [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) installed along with the necessary Python libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
